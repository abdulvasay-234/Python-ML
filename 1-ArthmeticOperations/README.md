# Data types in Python-ML
## Operation of data types in Python.
* Operator is a symbol that performs certain operations.
* Python provides the following set of operators
1. Arithmetic Operators
1. Relational Operators OR Comparison Operators
1. Logical operators
1. Bitwise operators
1. Assignment operators
1. Special operators
     
## Different Arithmetic Operations on numbers in Python.
* Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
* There are 7 arithmetic operators in Python :
  
 | Operator  |   Nam            | Example |
 |-----------|:----------------:|--------:|
 | +         | Addition         |  X+Y    |
 | -         | Subtraction      |  X-Y    |
 | *         | Multiplication   |  X*Y    |
 | /         | Division         |  X/Y    |
 | %         | Modulus          | X%Y     |
 | **        | Exponentiation   | X**Y    |
 | //        | Floor Division   | X//Y    |
 
> Note:
>* "/" operator always performs floating point arithmetic. Hence it will always returns float value.
>* But Floor division (//) can perform both floating point and integral arithmetic. If arguments
are int type then result is int type. If atleast one argument is float type then result is float type
