# Tuple
* Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and 
unchangeable.
* Tuples are written with round brackets
## Tuple Items
* Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
* Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc
## Tuple Length
* To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:
Create Tuple With One Item
* To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will 
not recognize it as a tuple.
