# String:
* Python string is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, 
or triple quotes. The computer does not understand the characters; internally, it stores 
manipulated character as the combination of the 0's and 1's.
* Each character is encoded in the ASCII or Unicode character. So we can say that Python 
strings are also called the collection of Unicode characters.

## Creating and Printing String in Python
* We can create a string by enclosing the characters in single-quotes or double- quotes. 
Python also provides triple-quotes to represent the string, but it is generally used for 
multiline string or docstrings.
